			Like every year, we are organising some side events in Bern too. We love to see who can
			balance the most impatiently at a red light, who can ride the longest in a meaningless circle
			without a pause to foot-down.

			<br /> <br />
			We'll leave it to you, to see the metaphor for life hereâ€¦

			<br /> <br />
			And, of course we have to figure out, whoâ€™s parents have no problem buying new tires for them every
			now and then.

			<br /> <br />
			So yeah, let's have fun. See you at the skid, trackstand and footdown ðŸ§¡
