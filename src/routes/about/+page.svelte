 GENERAL

 We would like to see respectful behavior at the checkpoints and on the
 Racecourse. Ride save enjoy the magnificent racecourse, the community and the
 rush. Be considerate at all times of those who share the course with you. Its
 all just a game! Drive safe! We do not tolerate unfair behavior. In case of
 misbehavior, breaking the rules or cheating it is up to the organizing
 committee to decide the consequences spontaneously. 


 You need a lock, a helmet and a backpack.


 Write your name and race number on each manifest. Read the manifest carefully,
 all the information you need is on it. The manifests must be in a decent
 condition and the stamps must be clearly visible so that the manifest can be
 evaluated.

 Inspection of the race course will be possible on Sunday from 8:30am to
 9:30am. Don't lurk around on the course after nine o'clock. There are some
 critical spots that require careful driving. It is recommended to try out the
 course in advance.The race course is mostly one-way, but there are also a few
 passages with two-way traffic. Keep to the track directions. No driving in the
 opposite direction! Do not drive on the grass.


 QUALIFICATION

 The race track is open from 9:30am. There are no defined starting slots. You
 decide when you want to start. You will get your first manifest with your
 start time at the race office. The last possible start time is at 11:30am. You
 have 1h30 time to collect as many points as possible, which decide about a
 final qualification. From 12:30 the cargo race will take place at the same
 time on the same course. If you want to avoid the Rushhour, you have to get up
 earlier.

 Points can be earned by completing jobs correctly. The manifests do not have
 to be completed. however, only correctly stamped jobs are scored

 The possible scores are visible on the manifests.

 You decide which jobs you want to complete. You may combine as many jobs as
 you like.

 The jobs are on a total at 5 manifests. You may work on 2 manifests at a time.
 For each manifest you hand in to the race office, you will receive a new one.
 You are responsible for knowing which manifests you have already completed.

 Your start time +1h30min is your deadline st the race office. If you are late,
 points will be deducted. If you have started a job on your last manifest, we
 will be generous. We can t prevent small waiting times at the race office -
 take this in to account.


 CARGO

 Cargo Race starts at 12:30. There is only 1 manifest. Your time will be
 counted when the manifest is handed in correctly at the race office. Some
 checkpoints may not be accessible with a loaded cargo bike. You are allowed to
 park the Cargo considerately and to walk the last meters. In order for the
 race office to let you participate in the Carco-Race, you need Cargo. If you
 are not sure if your bike is a Cargo, you can ask for an expertise at the race
 office. Your frontrack doesn't make your bike a cargobike. Your bag is not a
 cargobike. If you want to ride with a trailer, no one will stop you.
