<p class="py-4">
	SUICMC23 AwareMess welcomes you whole heartedly to this event - we're looking forward to spending
	a wonderful weekend filled with messfam, races, and events with all of you. The championship is
	traditionally a gathering bringing together various social realities, opinions, and expectations.
	To have a memorable time together, we find it crucial to set some expectations on how we would
	like to treat each other. As we understand the well-being and safety of all people present to be
	in our collective responsibility, we're inviting you to read this concept thoroughly and discuss
	it with peers. And most importantly to hold each other accountable in creating more reliable safer
	spaces.
</p>

<p class="py-4">
	The Swiss Cycling Messenger Community is a predominantly white and cis-male and privileged group
	of people. In order to promote solidarity and diversity within this wonderful community, we regard
	it as essential to cultivate a culture of respect and awareness - for one another as well as for
	our environment. We ask you to take notice of your surroundings and shared spaces, as well as the
	people in it. Be aware of and respect other people's boundaries. Help promoting a culture of
	consent. Be sensitive with each other and avoid assumptions about other people's experiences.
	Especially regarding gender, race, sexuality, or (physical and mental) health.
</p>

<p class="py-4">
	Discrimination of any kind is not welcome here. Because discriminative behaviour can be subtle,
	it's our responsibility to pay attention to what and how we're saying and doing things. Before you
	talk to a person check if they are up for it. If in doubt, ask them. Do not explain things without
	being asked to and grow into a habit of asking questions.
</p>

<p class="py-4">It's our responsibility to create accessible spaces and support structures.</p>

<p class="py-4">
	In whatever case you need support, assistance or anyone to talk to, AwareMess volunteers will be
	present during all the event. We have a phone number you can contact at any time and we support
	you within the scope of our possibilities.
</p>

<p class="py-4">
	If you notice someone seeming uncomfortable or harassed, try to support the concerned person i.e.
	going up to them and offering assistance if needed. Be considerate with each other and take
	responsibility, we're all part of the environment we'd like to create.
</p>

<p class="py-4">
	With all of this, we hope to create an inclusive, supportive, and respectful event together. If
	you have any questions or constructive feedback about this concept, please let us know. Also, are
	we still looking for people who would like to cover AwareMess shifts during the event. Please
	contact us if you'd like to get involved (<a href="mailto:awaremess@suicmc23.ch">

</p>
<p class="py-4">See you around ❤️ , <br /> AwareMess SUICMC23 Bern</p>
