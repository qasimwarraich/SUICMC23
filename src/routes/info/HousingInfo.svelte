		For the housing of SUICMC23 there‚Äôs a telegram chat where you can find a spot to sleep. For now
		there are private housing options from people from Bern. Contact possible hosts via PM, if
		you‚Äôre looking for a place to sleep. If you're from Bern and can host people please put your
		offer in the chat. Additionally, we're still trying hard to find a central housing spot. We‚Äôre
		also going to use the telegram chat to inform you about further housing options.
		<br /><br />
		Visit <a href="https://t.me/+j6Wkn0JDUspjODI0">https://t.me/+j6Wkn0JDUspjODI0</a>
		to join the chat.

		If it‚Äôs not possible for you to join the telegram chat, but you are looking for a place to
		sleep, please contact: +41 76 466 09 36
