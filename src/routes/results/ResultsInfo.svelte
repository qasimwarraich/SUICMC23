		The Organising committe of SUICMC23 has repeatedly dealt and been confronted with the topics of
		"categories" and "rankings" during the organisation of the event. This was due to criticism from
		cis-women in our group who did not feel comfortable with the usual categories.

		<br /><br />
		We have decided to organize a competitive race without the well-known categories "Open" and "WTNB+"
		from the courier championships. The result of this decision, as well as further discussions regarding
		representation and ratings, is the following large non-categorized and interactive result list. This
		allows all competitive couriers to compare themselves individually with different people in various
		ways through self-selected combinations of filter options, without categories based on gender or
		identity being assumed for comparison. The only sorting we have done is based on the achieved score.
		<br /><br />

		In an open letter which you can find here <span class="text-theme-1">(soon ðŸ˜…)</span>, we would like to go into more detail about
		this compromise and process.
