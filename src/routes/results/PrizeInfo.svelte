		Information on the prize ceremony: The usual categories (Open, WTNB+) have not been used for
		this event. This is the result of a collective decision by the organising committee. We will
		inform you in detail about the process of this decision in detail on our website. Furthermore,
		our prize ceremony is of an exceptional kind, as we have only one unified results list, and we
		do not want to shower the top ranks with prizes.

		<br /><br />
		Our main race team was given the task of designing a race that was as balanced as possible, where
		all people should be equal with their physical conditions, in terms of biological sex. You will have
		successfully participated in this experiment, and we are open hearing your feedback and input!

		<br /><br />
		With our general list of results, we want to promote an event culture where you can measure yourself
		with other people in the courier scene, instead of trying to be the best of the scene. That's why
		you will be able to highlight the results by e.g. age, fixed or team on our website. With this design,
		you will be able to interpret the results as they seem appropriate for you and measure yourself against
		the people you feel comfortable with.

		<br /><br />
		We don't reward first places, the first places on the list get to take home fame and glory.
